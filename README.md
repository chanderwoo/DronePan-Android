# DronePan-Android
This version is behind the iOS version and currently only supports the Inspire 1. We'll be working to bring this up to speed with DronePan for iOS.
## Main dev priorities
* Update to DJI SDK 3.0.1
* Introduce aircraft yaw for Phantom 3 and Inspire 1
* Introduce custom yaw angles to support the X5 gimbal
